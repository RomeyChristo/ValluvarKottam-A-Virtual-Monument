# ValluvarKottam - A Virtual Monument

Monuments are important as part of our history and culture, since they help us understand about communities which sustained in different periods with their own art, culture, and tradition. Also, the monuments will help us notice changes in the current societies and the reasons that cause the change in culture.

## Description about the project
This project aims at making the historical monuments of Tamil Nadu into digital art forms. It is an educational project funded by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), which was developed for aiding school students of Tamil Nadu to know about Tamil history and culture in an interactive way. This project supports the preservation of history, art, and culture by digitizing the monuments.
In this project, Valluvar Kottam, a monument in Chennai, dedicated to the classical Tamil poet and philosopher Valluvar, was created into a virtual monument. The project was developed by researching the monumentâ€™s history, culture, and finally bringing together the 3D art and programming using Unreal Engine and other tools. The application has been developed using gamification concepts.
I led a team of 4 students to work on the 3D modeling for this project. The project was developed in such a way that the user can move around freely in the virtual environment and interact with the surroundings. There are information boards (as shown in Fig.2 and Fig.5) placed around the virtual monument so that the user can learn about the history and the facts of the place and the monument.


## Development
My team and I had visited the monument and clicked pictures of the temple chariot, the artwork, and the surroundings. We interacted with the locals to get more detailed information regarding the monument. All the details were noted including rough sketches of the monument and the surrounding. Using the information, the 3D models of the environment were created using Blender 3D, an open-source 3D computer graphics software. These 3D models were brought into Unreal Engine to make the 3D surrounding interactive. The monument pictures that were clicked, were used for texturing the 3D models using digital art tools like GIMP and Photoshop.

## Advantages
1. Learning is made interesting.
2. This project has an edge over bookish learning.
3. A valuable source for students who are very far away from monuments.
4. The rich history and culture of the monument are virtually accessible to all and can be shared with others.
5. Monuments and art are digitally archived using this project.
6. Destroyed historical monuments can be restored in the digital art form through this
concept.
7. Can also be used as a Virtual tour assistant to support tourism.
8. Has greater advantages over rendered images, 360-degree panoramas, or videos.

## Further development
1. Integrating virtual reality for a much more immersive experience.
2. Adding more monuments.
3. Deploying a mobile version for easier access and wider reach.
4. Extend to create other educational tools like virtual labs and simulations.

## How to use this
Just download the repository, extract it, and then run the ValluvarKottam.exe file.
